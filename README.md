# Research-Project â€“ a cookiecutter template for research projects

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/template_version-1.0.0-brightgreen)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

This is a [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) template for (scientific) **research projects**.

## Usage

This template is used by [`scilaunch`](https://github.com/SHEscher/scilaunch) (a `cookiecutter` wrapper for scientific research projects):

```shell
# Install scilaunch
pip install -U scilaunch

# Create a new project in current folder
scilaunch

# alternatively link to parent folder
scilaunch path/to/parent/folder
```

The template can also be employed directly with [`cookiecutter`](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) using:

```shell
cookiecutter gh:SHEscher/research-project
```

However, ideally use this template with `scilaunch` to create your project, since there is some additional magic happening in the background.

## TODO's

- [ ] Option to add multiple authors
- [ ] Option to add project keywords
- [ ] Optional: Add examples for other data types than MRI, including simulation studies
