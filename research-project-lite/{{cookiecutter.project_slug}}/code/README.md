## Description

*List relevant information one needs to know about the code of this research project.
For instance, one could describe the computational model that was applied,
and which statistical approach has been chosen for.*

## Preprocessing

*General information regarding preprocessing could be written in the data [README.md](../data/README.md).
One could add here more implementation-specific information (e.g., which toolboxes were used).*

## Codebase

*Refer to the corresponding code/scripts written for the analysis/simulation/etc.
Which languages (Python, R, Matlab, ...) were used?
Are there specific package versions that one should take care of?
Or is there a container (e.g., Docker) or virtual environment?*

### Python

Python code is stored in `./code/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/`

#### Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks are stored in `./code/notebooks/`

### R

*Initialize a new R-project in the project root of `{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}` with `RStudio`.
R-scripts can be stored in `./code/Rscripts/`.
Use R-packages in Python with, e.g., [rpy2](https://rpy2.github.io/), or use Python packages in R using,
e.g., [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/)*.

### Configs

Paths to data, parameter settings, etc. can be stored in: `./code/configs/`

## COPYRIGHT/LICENSE

*One could add information about code sharing
(e.g., is the code published on GitLab or GitHub ...),
license and copy right issues*
